# Developer documentation
Below is a section for [plugins](#Plugins) and a section for [roles](#Roles).
The plugins are usable as an Ansible playbook. 
They can be used stand-alone or as a SURF Researchcloud plugin.

The roles serve as reusable building blocks for these playbooks.

When adding documentation, please consider to format your text
using the file [template-plugins.md](plugins/template-plugins.md) to
document a plugin
or the file [template-roles.md](roles/template-roles.md) to document a role.
