# Developer documentation
Below is a section for [playbooks](#Playbooks) and a section for [roles](#Roles).
The playbook can be used stand-alone (run them locally on the target host) 
or as a SURF ResearchCloud plugin.

The roles serve as reusable building blocks for these playbooks.

When adding documentation, please consider to format your text
using the file [template-playbooks.md](playbooks/template-playbooks.md) to
