# ResearchCloud first-time use
[back to index](../primer-for-users.md)

The [SURF ResearchCloud Wiki](https://servicedesk.surfsara.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Research+Cloud+Documentation)
pages provide an elaborate introduction on concepts related to this cloud service. 

### Preparation
- To *access* an already created, running workspace, 
you need to be a member of the related *collaborative organization*.
Logon to [SURF ResearchCloud portal](https://portal.live.surfresearchcloud.nl/) 
and navigate in the menu to "Profile" to list your collaborative organization
memberships.   
Use a UU Servicedesk call to [request a new collaboration](https://uu.topdesk.net) is created.


- To *create* a workspace you need to be a member of a collaborative
organization. It also requires that you have a *wallet* attached
to your account. The running costs of the workspace will be charged
to the cost center of your wallet. It is common to have a wallet per project.   
Use a UU Servicedesk call to [request a new wallet](https://uu.topdesk.net). Ideally
include your project's cost center WBS in the call.

### Guidelines for managing a workspace
- Suspend ("pause") the workspace when you do not need to access it for
the remainder of the day. Suspending or resuming a workspace 
only takes a minute and minimizes the charges on your cost center.

- Avoid unnecessary charges: consider to delete the workspace 
if you do not plan to use it for a prolonged number of days.  
Usually it takes less than 30 minutes to recreate a workspace.    
***NB: make sure that you have safe-guarded your valuable data 
by saving it to a location external to the workspace, 
for instance Yoda or ResearchDrive.*** Once a workspace is deleted,
all data held locally on that workspace is purged (unrecoverable).
