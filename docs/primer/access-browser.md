# Access workspace using a web browser
[back to index](../primer-for-users.md)

### Preparation
No need to install any software, a web browser suffices.

Access to the workspace requires that you register a time-based 
one-time password (TOTP). See the SURF wiki for instructions 
to [configure a time-based password](https://servicedesk.surfsara.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Log+in+to+your+workspace).


### Accessing a running workspace
Login to [SURF ResearchCloud portal](https://portal.live.surfresearchcloud.nl).
The dashboard shows the workplaces that you have access to.
Unfold the workspace to check the text underneath "URL".
If the URL starts with "https://" then the workspace includes 
a graphical desktop that can be accessed using a browser.
Click the yellow "access" button to navigate to the workspace.

### Howto cut/paste data from laptop/workstation to workspace
Note that data that you cut/paste locally on your laptop/workstation 
remains local, it is not shared with the workspace.

To copy data to the workspace:
1. Copy or cut the data locally at the source
2. Press CTL-ALT-SHIFT, this opens a hidden "Guacamole" menu in your browser
   (on a touch screen: swipe right from the left edge of the screen)
3. Paste the data on the Guacamole menu clipboard.
   This will transfer the data to the workspace.
4. In the workspace just paste the data into an application.
5. Press CTL-ALT-SHIFT again to hide the Guacamole menu 

Data can also be copied in the opposite direction. 
The [Guacamole clipboard](https://guacamole.apache.org/doc/gug/using-guacamole.html#using-the-clipboard) 
on your laptop/workstation reflects the content of the workspace clipboard.
