# Your first-time use of SURF ResearchCloud
[back to index](../primer-for-users.md)

### Preparation
- To access an already created, running workspace, 
you need to be a member of the related collaborative organization.
Logon to [SURF ResearchCloud portal](https://portal.live.surfresearchcloud.nl/) 
and navigate in the menu to "Profile" to list your collaborative organization
memberships. 

- To create a workspace you need to be a member of a collaborative
organization. It also requires that you have a wallet attached
to your account. The running costs of the workspace will be charged
to the cost center of your wallet.

### Guidelines for managing a workspace
- Suspend ("pause") the workspace when you do not need to access it for
the remainder of the day. Suspending or resuming a workspace 
only takes a minute and minimizes the charges on your cost center.

- Avoid unnecessary charges: consider to delete the workspace 
if you do not plan to use it for a prolonged number of days.  
Usually it takes less than 30 minutes to recreate a workspace.
NB: make sure that you have safe-guarded your valuable data to a location
external to the workspace, for instance Yoda or ResearchDrive.
