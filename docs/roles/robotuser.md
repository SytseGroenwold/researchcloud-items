# Role robotuser
[back to index](../index.md#Roles)

## Summary
Adds a robot user along with a private ssh key.

## Requires
n/a

## Description
Add a robot user to the system. 
This user can be used e.g. in sudo actions for accessing other nodes, 
provided that such node has authorized the robot's public key.

To facilitate connections over ssh protocol, a file `connection-info.yml` 
with information for mount purposes is placed in the home directory of the 
robotuser and the server node is added to the known hosts.  

This role requires the plugin/playbook to provide some Ansible variables as
parameter: `robotuser_key` (private ssh key), `robotuser_server` (ip address), 
`robotuser_sourcepath` (server directory as data source for mounts).

Server-side robotuser ceration is supported by setting `robotuser_generate_ssh_key:"yes"`.

For an example robotuser use case, please see the [matlab](../playbooks/matlab.md) playbook.

## Variables
```
robotuser_name: "uurobot"
robotuser_key: "** generated by Ansible script. Please make sure your playbook specifies a private key as the value for the variable 'robotuser_key' **"
robotuser_generate_ssh_key: "no"
robotuser_server:  # no default value! 
robotuser_sourcepath:  # no default value!
```
When the variable `robotuser_generate_ssh_key` is set to "yes" then a public/private key pair
is generated for this user. The use case for this setting is creation of the robotuser at a server
instead of a client.
