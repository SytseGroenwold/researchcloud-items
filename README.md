# researchcloud-items
This repository contains [Ansible](ansible.com) installation scripts for use in conjunction with [SURF ResearchCloud](https://portal.live.surfresearchcloud.nl).   
Alternatively you can clone this repository on a target host and locally run the playbooks using the command  
`ansible-playbook <name-of-the-playbook>`. 

If the code for an Ansible role is made available using a specific licence then that license is listed as a file in the root directory of that role. The code for the remaining roles is made available using the license specified in the top-level directory of this repository. 

Please see the [documentation](doc/index.md) for a list and details on included playbooks and roles.
