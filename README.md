# researchcloud-items
This repository contains [Ansible](ansible.com) installation scripts for use in conjunction with [SURF ResearchCloud](https://portal.live.surfresearchcloud.nl). You can add a playbook as a script for a ResearchCloud plugin.  
Alternatively feel free to clone this repository on a target host and locally run a playbook using the command  
`ansible-playbook <name-of-the-playbook>`. 

If the code for an Ansible role is made available using a specific licence then that license is listed as a file in the root directory of that role. The code for the remaining roles is made available using the license specified in the top-level directory of this repository. 

Please consult the [documentation](doc/index.md) before using a playbook to find out if the playbook meets your use case.
